DLSU CATVAS is a website application that provides an online database for DLSU PUSA. This allows users to view cats that are still up for adoption, already adopted, and those who are in the process of being domesticated. It also allows users to make their own accounts to post cats they see within DLSU. These accounts also allows them to meowt (like) photos and comment on posts.
